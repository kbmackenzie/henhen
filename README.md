HenHen is a build tool for CHICKEN Scheme, designed to work alongside `chicken-install`. It can:

- Manage dependencies in a **local environment**â€”no more system-wide installs!
- Handle **multiple interdependent source files + modules** seamlessly.
- Fetch and install dependencies from **anywhere** by specifying a URL. No need to rely on the [official egg index][1] anymore.
