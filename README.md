HenHen is a build tool for CHICKEN Scheme, designed to work alongside `chicken-install`. It can:

- Install dependencies in an **isolated virtual environment**. No more system-wide installs!
- Manage multiple local eggs seamlessly, and build them together.
- Fetch and install dependencies from **anywhere** by specifying an URL. No need to rely entirely on the [official egg index][1]!

It creates an isolated egg repository for each project inside a `.henhen` folder.

With HenHen, you can experiment with eggs all you want without polluting your global CHICKEN installationâ€”and if anything ever goes wrong on the way, all you need to do to get a fresh start with a clean slate is run `henhen clean --purge`.

## Philosophy

HenHen is designed for convenience. I wrote this to get around some of the behavior of `chicken-install` that I disliked; namely:

- By default, `chicken-install` installs every egg **globally**, system-wide.
- Because of the *default location of the egg repository*, `chicken-install` requires superuser privilleges to install eggs (see [this section][2]). To change the repository location, you must either *build CHICKEN from source* or *set specific environment variables*.

HenHen is designed to circumvent **both of these issues** with as little hassle as possible, creating a virtual environment for each project.

## Installation

HenHen is a single binary executable. A comprehensive installation guide can be found [here](./INSTALL.md).

The guide linked above also includes steps to build HenHen from source!
